### URL: https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ee12001/LTW/Projeto/

Event management website. The user has the possibility to create, change and remove their own events as well as join the existing
ones. Each event contains a comments section.

This website was created within the scope of a Web Languages and Technologies subject and it was built by 2 students. 
As a challenge of this course, the students couldn't use any frameworks, so this website was built using pure PHP, Javascript and all of the CSS was implemented without relying on Bootstrap or any template.
